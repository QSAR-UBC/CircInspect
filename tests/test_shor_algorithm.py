"""
Regression tests using a real, algorithmically complex circuit (QPE-based
Shor's algorithm) as a test case. This circuit has deeply nested loops with
subroutine calls, several helper functions with returns at varying indent
levels, and mid-circuit measurements that later loop iterations condition
on via qp.cond: the exact shape of circuit that exposed bugs in:

  - command_tree_helpers.update_parent_id (return commands inside nested
    scf/call frames being attributed to the wrong enclosing scope)
  - frontend_helpers.draw_circuit (collapsed loop/subroutine blocks whose
    placeholder gate, or the qnode's terminal return measurement, referenced
    mid-circuit measurements that were never queued onto the synthetic
    drawing tape, crashing PennyLane's drawer)
